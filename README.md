script to install nvidia drivers in Arch linux 
i'm pretty lazy to write the entire packages everytime i install new distro 

## How do i use it? 
get into tty by using shortcut 
> Ctrl + Alt + F1 

and change your directory to your cloned repo
> cd nv-arch 

changing permission 
> chmod +x nv.sh

and finally the installation
